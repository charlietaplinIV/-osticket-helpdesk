# 🧰 Help Desk Ticketing System – osTicket Lab (Windows Server)

This project sets up a fully functional, self-hosted help desk ticketing system using **osTicket** on **Windows Server 2022** with **IIS**, **PHP**, and **MySQL**. The goal is to simulate real-world IT support workflows—including ticket generation, role-based response management, and SLA enforcement—for portfolio demonstration and hands-on learning.
